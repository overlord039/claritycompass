/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-specific data,
 * including profiles, tasks, and relationships with universities, is stored in a private data tree
 * accessible only to the authenticated owner. This prevents users from accessing or even knowing
 * about each other's data.
 *
 * Data Structure: User data is hierarchically organized under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based
 * ownership is the cornerstone of the security model. Publicly accessible data, like the list of
 * universities, is stored in a separate top-level collection (`/universities`) to ensure clear
 * and performant separation between private and public information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Strict Ownership: A user can only read or write documents within their own `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - Public Read-Only Data: The `/universities` collection is readable by any signed-in user but
 *   is locked down against all client-side writes to maintain data integrity. Administrator-level
 *   changes must be made using server-side SDKs that bypass these rules.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents within a user's data tree must contain a `userId`
 *   field that matches the `{userId}` in the path, ensuring a consistent and auditable link to
 *   the owner. This field is enforced as immutable on updates.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The rules rely on the `{userId}` wildcard in the document
 * path as the primary mechanism for authorization. This avoids costly `get()` calls to other
 * documents. Additionally, user-specific documents (like Tasks) contain a denormalized `userId`
 * field, which is validated against the path to ensure data consistency and clear ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The separation of private user data (`/users/{userId}/...`) from public
 * data (`/universities`) is a core design choice. This makes security rules simpler and allows
 * for safe, efficient list operations on the public collection without risking exposure of
 * private information.
